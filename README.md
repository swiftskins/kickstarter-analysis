# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In order to better understand how various campaigns, specific to the category of plays, fared in relation to launch dates and funding goals, we are analyzing a robust data set inclusive of over four thousand kickstarter media and entertainment campaigns spanning twenty one countries. 
With a clearer understanding of which launch dates were most successful when also reviewing what funding goals were most successful, Louise will be able to make more informed decisions about her next campaign. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to better understand how various campaigns, specific to the category of plays, fared in relation to launch dates and funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
The first analysis, i.e. comparing theater outcomes to launch dates, is designed to help us identify any timing trends. 
Given the sparse number of cancellations, it is difficult to draw any conclusion other than highlighting the month of January (which could be an outlier) as being the month with the highest amount. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first analysis, i.e. comparing theater outcomes to launch dates is designed to help us identify any timing trends. Given the sparse number of cancellations, it is difficult to draw any conclusion other than highlighting the month of January (which could be an outlier) as being the month with the highest amount. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
An equal chance of success and failure occurs when one has a goal between $15K - $19.9K, and almost a an equal change between $20K - $24.9K. Chance of failure is low for campaigns less than 5K, and between $40K - $44.9K; however, the data set in the $40K range is insignificant.  
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The countifs function represents a longer equation which provided a greater opportunity for errors - I erreroneously limited the country to GB at first. Reformatting the charts to update the x axis on the goals range required experimenting with different styles and functions. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
It is abundantly clear the greatest opportunity for success is to launch between May and July; more specifically, the lowest percentage of launch to failure is within May and June. It is equally advisable to stay away December as one has almost an equal chance of failure to success. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
If Louise sets a goal under five thousand dollars, she has a seventy five percent chance of successful based on similar campaigns 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There is limited data on larger goal campaigns which makes it difficult to draw any conclusions. For example, of the one thousand and thirty one campaigns, only twenty six had goals of greater than twenty five thousand dollars.
We don’t take into account or correlate success with the type of play – are there any trends/correlations to uncover?
The goal amounts are in mixed currency, and therefore, some of the analysis is skewed, e.g. some currencies have very little purchasing power, and Louise will have to filter the data for the country in which she plans to launch, e.g. Great Britain. 
It is not clear why none of the campaigns were canceled. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A clustered chart would help us compare a few categories – for both data sets. 
It would be beneficial to also analyize the percentage of success and failure for outcomes by launch date.
